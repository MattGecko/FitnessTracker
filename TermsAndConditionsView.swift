import SwiftUI

struct TermsAndConditionsView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                Text("Terms & Conditions")
                    .font(.largeTitle)
                    .padding(.bottom)

                Text("""
                1. Terms and Conditions (Ts&Cs) Implementation:
                We can load the Ts&Cs from a text file or URL and display it in a scrollable view on the settings screen.
                Quick Win: Load the Ts&Cs into the settings view for quick access.

                2. Contact Support Pre-filled Email:
                When users click "Contact Support," we can open the default mail app, pre-fill the subject with something like "Support Request" and add basic system information (device type, app version, etc.) in the body.
                Quick Win: Opens an email draft with system info.

                3. Dark Mode Support:
                Add support for Dark Mode if not already in place. This will make the app look modern and provide a better user experience for those using Dark Mode.
                Quick Win: Implement system-based dark mode in the app if SwiftUI doesn't automatically handle it.

                4. Clear Data Option:
                A button in the settings that allows users to clear all tracked data (meals, favourites, etc.). This can be useful if someone wants to start fresh or reset their logs.
                Quick Win: Clear meal data in UserSettings and reset stored favourites.

                5. Search Placeholder Text:
                Improve the user experience by adding some placeholder text in the search bar like "Search food by name...".
                Quick Win: Placeholder text helps guide the user on what to do.

                6. Meal Logging Confirmation:
                Add a simple alert or toast message that confirms when a meal has been successfully logged, giving users instant feedback that their action worked.
                Quick Win: Provide user feedback after logging a meal.

                7. Frequently Added Items Section:
                Show a list of recently added meals or recently searched food items on the Meal Tracker view. This helps users quickly re-log items they've used recently.
                Quick Win: Add a recent meals section that shows the last 5 meals.

                8. Swipe to Delete in Search History:
                Allow users to swipe to delete recent or frequent food items from the search history, adding more control and flexibility to the search feature.
                Quick Win: Simple gesture-based swipe-to-delete for food history.

                9. Custom Meal Reminders:
                Add a feature in settings to schedule meal reminders. Users can get a push notification reminding them to log breakfast, lunch, or dinner at specific times.
                Quick Win: Add reminders functionality to help users track meals more consistently.

                10. Hydration Tracker:
                Add a simple hydration tracker. Users can log how much water they drink daily, with small rewards (e.g., a simple message) for reaching certain hydration goals.
                Quick Win: Track hydration with a simple number input and display.

                11. Export Data:
                Add a feature allowing users to export their meal data to a CSV or share via email.
                Quick Win: Export data to a shareable format.

                These ideas can be implemented with varying levels of effort. Let me know if you'd like to implement some of these now!

                Okay good, can you write me up some ts&cs for this app? Make it clear that people should not rely on this alone to lose weight, any calorie targets given are an estimate and not medical advice, and that they should seek professional advice before starting any sort of calorie controlled diet

                Hereâ€™s a draft for the Terms & Conditions (Ts&Cs) for your app. It emphasizes the non-medical nature of the calorie recommendations, encourages users to seek professional advice, and outlines general app usage terms.

                Terms & Conditions
                1. Introduction
                Welcome to our calorie tracking app. By using this application, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully before using the app. If you disagree with any part of these terms, you should not use this application.

                2. Non-Medical Nature of Information
                The information provided by this app, including calorie targets, BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) calculations, and other nutritional information, is for informational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice or a substitute for professional consultation, diagnosis, or treatment.

                You should not rely on the information provided in this app as a basis for any health or weight management decisions. Always seek the advice of a physician or qualified health professional before starting any weight loss or calorie-controlled diet, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions.

                3. Calorie Targets and Estimates
                Calorie targets and BMR calculations provided by the app are estimates only and should not be considered as precise or definitive. These calculations are based on the information you provide (such as age, weight, height, and activity level) and common formulas used for nutritional estimations. The accuracy of these targets may vary based on individual metabolic differences and other factors.

                IMPORTANT: These estimates should not be used as the sole guide for weight loss, fitness, or health decisions. Always consult with a healthcare provider or dietitian for a personalized and safe approach to managing your weight and nutrition.

                8. Third-Party Services
                The app may integrate with third-party services or databases (such as food databases) for providing nutritional information. We do not take responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of third-party data.

                9. User Data and Privacy
